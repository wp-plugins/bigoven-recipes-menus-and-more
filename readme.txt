**Notes on connecting back to BigOven.com**

   To perform it's task this plugin makes an HTTP connection to the BigOven API at api.bigoven.com,
   stores this data in your local database, and generates HTML to present the recipe or menu. This
   occurs typically once per recipe or menu, and does not occur on a per page load basis. The local
   cache stores a copy of the recipe or menu for highest performance viewing.

   The HTML that is generated by this plugin includes photographs of the recipe or menu that are 
   hosted by BigOven.com, hence link to the BigOven domain. The recipes and menus also links to 
   your pages on BigOven.com enabling users to get rich functionality such as "add to grocery list",
   "add to menu plan" and "print" and so on.

**Basic Usage**

Once installed, use the following shortcodes:

	[bigoven-recipe	url="http://www.bigoven.com/recipe/158615/Radish-Mice-Decorations"]
